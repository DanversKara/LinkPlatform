⚠️ Upgrading from v10.4
No database schema changes between v10.4 and v10.5. All fixes are frontend-only.

To patch an existing v10.4 install without a full reset, download and run the standalone patch script:

Run the following commands in your terminal (inside the project directory) to clean up and rebuild
Stop any running containers

docker compose down -v


Clear Docker's build cache

docker builder prune -f


Re-run the setup script

./setup.sh
